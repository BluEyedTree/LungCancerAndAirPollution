The goal of this project was to find the correlation between various air pollutants and the rate of lung cancer in US metropolitan areas.

The findings are summarized in the image below:

Legend:

MSACODE- Unique Identifier for a given metropolitan area.

Age Adjusted Cancer Rate - Instance of Cancer per 100,000 individuals, adjusted for the age of the population.

Average Smoking Rate - Number of self-reported smokers per 100,000 individuals.

AQI - (Air Quality Index) An EPA aggregate statistic that defines the level of a given pollutant for a day. For this project,
the average AQI for the year 2012 was used for comparisons. 

Findings:

There is a strong positive correlation between ciggeratte smoking and Age Adjusted Cancer Rate. Moreover,
there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of one pollutant and the presence of others.
These two points were expected. Howerver, it was unexpected that a higher AQI would be negatively correlated with age adjusted cancer rate. I would venture to say other factors are at play within metropolitan areas that have a greater affect on the rate of lung cancer than pollution. Also, if more rural areas were included in this analysis then I would have expected the AQI to be more positively correlated with lung cancer rates.
